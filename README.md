Welcome to my little Programm which I coded - as you can see its a random password generater

# Things that are done 

--> Generate a random Password for you 
    - this string is saved in a .txt file 
 
--> Function which shows your generated password 

--> It will create automatically a rpg.txt file for you, if you dont have one already

--> Date and Time will also be there when the string is generated

--> Input which ask the user if you wants to keep this password
    - if you type yes, then it will ask you for what usage is it needed
    - if you type no, then the programm will close 

--> Now have a look in your .txt file

# Things that needs to be finished
