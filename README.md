Welcome to my little Programm which I coded - as you can see its random password generater

# Things that are done 

--> Generate a random Password for you 
    - this string is safed in a file 
 
 --> Function wth the context

 --> Date and Time will also be there when the string is generated

# Things that needs to be finished 

--> input which ask the user for what usage its needed
    - passwords that are used for something needs to be safed in a extra file

--> check if you have the file rpg.txt, if not then create this one

--> stuff =)

Have Fun ...
