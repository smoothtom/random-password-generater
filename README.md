Welcome to my little Programm which I coded - as you can see its a random password generater

# Things that the programm can do 

-> Generate a random Password for you - this password is saved in a .txt file
 
-> Function which shows your generated password 

-> It will create automatically a rpg.txt file for you, if you don't have one already

-> Date and Time will also be there when the password is generated

-> Input which ask the user if you want to keep this password
   * if you type yes, then it will ask you for what usage is it needed
   * if you type no, then the programm will close 

Now have a look in your .txt file :)
